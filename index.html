    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
        links scroll to section of the page

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
        the my work area has titled images (like in example, inages with titles over them)

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
        The first image is bigger like in the picture, doesn't matter what it is

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
        images have links to the site or where the application is (deployed?)

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
